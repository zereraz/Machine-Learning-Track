## Simple Linear Regression via Ordinary Least Squares
 * inspired, taken from [Simple Linear Regression from scratch](http://www.beeandkey.com/2017/07/simple-linear-regression-from-scratch.html)
 * derivation of the formula: [ordinary least squares](https://theclevermachine.wordpress.com/2012/09/01/derivation-of-ols-normal-equations/)
 * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_least_squares

TODO:
 * Add animation for line reaching appropriate slope and intercept
 * Use generalized version of Ordinary Least Squares and fit higher degree polynomial curves
