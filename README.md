# Machine Learning Track

* Decompose Machine Learning concepts
* Math behind them
* Julia examples of the Math
* Various visual examples to help build intuition
* Curation with explanations from variety of sources

## An overview to Machine learning
[Introduction](./Introduction.md)

## Start jupyter notebook
`julia Main.jl`
Note: `it runs IJulia in detached mode so you may have to kill the jupyter server when done`

## Main references:
 * https://mml-book.github.io
 * http://vmls-book.stanford.edu (Julia companion)

(aim is to use free and accessible online resources)
